# quizApp
A simple PHP + Javascript quiz app with drag and drop for academic purposes. 

Problems solved:
- 6 versions for two languages
- random browse to the version from index site
- drag and drop module
- dumping results to a .txt file instead of a database

Room for improvement:
- randomizing the setup of the drag and drop elements
- hiding the right order of the answers behind some encryption or obviously just connecting them with database.
